            <p class="sectionTag text-big">What are Programming Languages ?</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag">A programming language is any set of rules that converts strings, or
                graphical program elements in the case of visual programming languages, to various kinds of machine code
                output. Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer programming to
                implement algorithms.
                Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that
                use a
                set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages. Since the early 1800s, programs
                have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player
                pianos.
                The programs for these machines (such as a player piano's scrolls) did not produce different behavior in
                response to different inputs or conditions.
                Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year.
                Many
                programming languages are written in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform)
                while
                other languages use the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).
                The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and
                semantics (meaning), which are usually defined by a formal language. Some languages are defined by a
                specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while
                other
                languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages
                have
                both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant
                implementation
                being common.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">About Python</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag">Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy
                emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and
                object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small- and large-scale
                projects.
                Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
                structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described
                as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
                Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming
                language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and
                introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference
                counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely
                backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">About Java</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag">Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is
                designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming
                language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java
                code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are
                typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the
                underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level
                facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and
                runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of
                2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,
                particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.
                Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in May 1995 as a core
                component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers,
                virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of
                May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most
                of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual
                Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source
                software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">About HTML</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag">The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for
                documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
                into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
                included cues for the appearance of the document.
                HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such
                as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured
                documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes
                and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as
                &ltimg/> and &ltinput/> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as
                &ltp> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.
                Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
                HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior
                and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web
                Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has
                encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997. A form of HTML, known as
                HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the &ltcanvas> element, in collaboration with
                    javascript.
